Hello, and welcome to my new blog!

### Who is this guy?    
My name is Joe Nyland and I am a developer who lives in Grappenhall, Warrington and I work at Formisimo.

### Ok, what's the blog all about?

I've decided to try to keep a blog of things that I face on my journey through life and I hope to find time to talk
about the things that interest me most.
