Hello, and welcome to my new blog!

### Who is this guy?    
My name is Joe Nyland and I am a developer who lives in [Northwich][1] and I work at [Formisimo][2].

### Ok, what's the blog all about?

I've decided to try to keep a blog of things that I face on my journey through life and I hope to find time to talk
about the things that interest me most.

You can expect to find posts and articles on the following subjects:

* DevOps: Development and Operations management
* General coding and general "hackery"
* SysAdmin: System Administration
* Mountain and road biking
