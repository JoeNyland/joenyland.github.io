title: GitHub Pages may soon support SSL!
excerpt: Looks like GitHub are testing SSL support of GitHub Pages.

I was checking out some settings on my GitHub account today and I noticed in the
[Security section](https://github.com/settings/security), several messages like this:

<img src="/assets/img/posts/github-pages-may-soon-support-ssl/security_log.png" alt="Security log screenshot" class="security-log-screenshot center img-responsive img-rounded"/>

Hmm... `repo.pages_https_redirect_disabled` ...I don't remember changing that setting. I don't even know where that
setting is! I reached out to the awesome GitHub support team and they tell me that they've been working on an
"experimental" feature: :grinning:

> Sorry for the audit log noise! An experimental feature was accidentally enabled for your repository...

So, it looks like we *may* be seeing SSL on GitHub Pages sometime soon!
