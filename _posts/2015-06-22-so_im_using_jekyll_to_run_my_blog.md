I'm running the fabulous [Jekyll][jekyll] framework. If you've not already taken a look at
[Jekyll][jekyll], you should really check it out! This whole site is running on [GitHub Pages][github-pages] (for
free, that's free as in free beer!) and is completely open source and available to be forked and contributed to on
GitHub [here][github-repo].

In the past, I've used and also supported the likes of [Wordpress][wordpress] and [Joomla][joomla] CMS systems for
blogs and small ecommerce sites, but when I started using [GitHub][github] a few years back, I found that they provide
an awesome feature called [GitHub Pages][github-pages] and through that: [Jekyll][jekyll].
 
Admittedly, [Jekyll][jekyll] is noway near the feature packed, sometimes bloated CMS system that [Wordpress][wordpress]
is, but it's just as extensible as it's ultimately running Ruby code and outputting HTML to static files which can be
hosted by pretty much any webserver you choose.

If you notice any issues with my blog, please do raise a new issue on the issue tracker page [here][github-issues].
Better still, it would be great if you could [fork the repo][github-kb-fork], then submit a pull request (PR)
[here][github-pr]. Thanks!
