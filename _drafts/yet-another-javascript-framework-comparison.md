title: Yet another JavaScript framework comparison
excerpt: I've seriously lost count of all of the JS frameworks out there! Let's try a few on for size.

Recently, I've been trying to increase my knowledge and exposure to some of the main JavaScript frontend frameworks.
One issue I faced was that I couldn't decide which one to use for each project that I needed a framework for. There's
just so many JS frameworks out there! Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages, style and learning curve.
Although there's lots of blog posts on the internet comparing JS frameworks, I decided that I wanted to do my own
version. Who knows, it might help someone else decide!
