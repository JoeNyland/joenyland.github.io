title: I'm doing the Manchester to Blackpool charity bike ride
excerpt: What better way to raise money for charity?
---

Recently, I've been trying to get back into my mountain biking. It's been tough, because I've been
out of it for around 12 months now. I gave up cycling all together last year, following a rough patch with my
depression. I completely gave it up: sold all by gear, all my bikes and vowed that I would never cycle again and I
didn't. Fast forward 10 months and I was managing my depression and the hunger to ride was building once again!

A week or so ago, an email was sent around the office at work asking if anyone was interested in doing the Manchester
to Blackpool charity bike ride. I'm not a massively confident person and I have terrible trouble with my head telling me
a million reasons why I wouldn't be able to overcome a challenge, but I've got really good at managing that thought now.
18-24 months ago I would never have said that I'd have the courage to ride from Manchester to Blackpool; the negative
thoughts would creep in and talk me out of it well before I managed to sign up for a ride like that. Now, though, I've
been able to battle through that and sign myself up to the do the ride!

The bike ride is in aid of [The Christie Charity][the-christie-site] and is a 60 mile ride from the Imperial War
Museum in Trafford, Manchester to the South Promenade, Blackpool. Those 60 miles will take us through Leigh, Wigan,
Preston, Warton and into Blackpool. Admittedly, I'm apprehensive, but I'm actually quite looking forward to it. It will
be a challenge, but I'm looking forward to overcoming it and raising some money for
[The Christie Charity][the-christie-site] along the way!

I will update this post when I somewhere setup where you can sponsor me for the ride.
