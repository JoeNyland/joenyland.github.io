        <p>My name is <b>Joe Nyland</b> and I live in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nJaJl" target="_blank">Warrington, UK</a>.</p>

            I started my career back in 2009, when I joined the system support team at <a href="http://www.kaleida.co.uk" target="_blank">Kaleida</a>
            in Trafford Park, Manchester. At Kaleida, I gained experience supporting and maintaining
            <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/" target="_blank">Windows</a> desktops and servers for around 400
            users. I was asked to take on an important project, which utilised my experience with
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html" target="_blank">Linux</a> and allowed me to gain commercial experience
            supporting and maintaining Linux servers and also the <a href="http://www.asterisk.org" target="_blank">Asterisk</a> VOIP communications
            server.

        <p>
            In January 2013, I took the decision to move to <a href="http://www.ukfast.co.uk" target="_blank">UKFast</a>, who were based in Manchester
            city centre. I was employed at UKFast as a Linux engineer, providing telephone and email support in a diverse and fast paced business.
            During my time at both Kaleida and UKFast, I began to gain an interest in web sites and web development and in my spare time, I like to
            read and learn about web development as much as possible, to try and further my knowledge. I also enjoy keeping up to date on the latest
            and greatest open source projects.

            When I get chance, I like to go to Wales or up to the Lake District mountain biking, exploring some of the quieter parts of Cheshire on my
            road bike, or up in Scotland sea kayaking. You can follow my cycling progress on
            <a href="http://www.strava.com/" target="_blank">Strava</a>, where I upload all of my rides:

            In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music and reading. I also enjoy nice long walks with my dogs, come rain or shine :)
