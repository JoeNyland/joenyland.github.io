            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there!</p>
            <p>My name is Joe Nyland. I'm a 25 year old developer who lives in Grappenhall, Warrington, UK. Here's a
                bit about me.</p>
            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>So, by day I work at <a href="http://www.formisimo.com" target="_blank">Formisimo</a>, who are a
                Manchester based company who provide form analytics services to over 100 countries across the world.
                I started working at <a href="http://www.formisimo.com" target="_blank">Formisimo</a> in 2014, when
                there were only a few members on the team and I've been there whilst it grows and flourishes as a
                company.</p>
            <p>On a day to day basis as <a href="http://www.formisimo.com" target="_blank">Formisimo</a>, I'm usually
                working on frontend development (mainly in PHP) or working on the backend Ruby code which handles our
                interaction data as it floods in from our client's user's browsers all across the world. I also take
                on a "DevOps-style" role there: we are a small condensed team and it makes sense to build and optimise
                the infrastructure around the development team, their requirements for a lightening fast, scalable and
                reliable infrastructure to run our services on. Coming from a SysAdmin background working of companies
                like <a href="http://www.ukfast.co.uk" target="_blank">UKFast</a>, this is definitely an area of my
                current role where I feel right at home, when I'm not coding, of course!</p>

            <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
            <p>In my spare time, I'm usually at home working away refining my skills to help out further at work,
                reading up on the newest a greatest in the tech world. When I've had enough of technology for the day,
                or I'm just fed up with looking at a screen all day, I love taking my dogs for walks around the local
                countryside, allowing me to get some much needed fresh air and also some space to think.</p>
            <p>I'm also a keen cyclist, focusing mainly on mountain biking. I've also done a fair bit of road and track
                cycling over the years, but nothing beats the feeling of bombing it down the side of a mountain,
                holding on for dear life! :) I love the sense of satisfaction when you arrive home after a long day of
                mountain biking in Wales, where you're wet through with rain, your legs are aching from all the
                pedalling up "for one last go" and you know you've just about managed to come home in one piece.
                Then, you know you've given the day your all!</p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>Whether I'm at home, at work, on the bike or out for a walk, music is pretty much constantly on in my
                life. I have a large and eclectic collection and taste in music, ranging from classic Hip-Hop with the
                Sugar Hill Gang, to classical pieces, chilled out alternative from the likes of Elbow, electronic from
                Daft Punk and who doesn't like a bit of classic rock from the likes of Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath?</p>
            <p>On my list of things to do before I die, I want to learn how to play the piano, guitar and drums.
                Well, you've got to aim for something haven't you?</p>
