    Hey, I'm Joe Nyland and this is my blog!
    I'll try to write about interesting things related to DevOps,
    coding, SysAdmin and other things that interest me as I fumble
    my way through life, laughing and learning along the way.
    I can't guarantee that everything will be interesting, but I'll try!
